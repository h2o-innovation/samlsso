**V1.3.3**
- Performance: `updateLastActivity()` now throttles the `lastClickTime` database write (30s) instead of issuing a full row `UPDATE` on every authenticated request/AJAX call. The in-memory value is still refreshed; only the redundant write is skipped, so inactivity timeouts (minute granularity) are unaffected.
- Performance: Added `idx_loginstates_phase` and `idx_loginstates_lastclick` indexes to the login states table. `expireStaleAcsRequests()` and `expireStaleGlpiSessions()` filter by `phase` on every request and the `cleanSessionSAML` cron task deletes by `lastClickTime`; without these indexes the queries degrade into full table scans as the table grows, slowing down every GLPI request.
- Performance: `expireStaleGlpiSessions()` now loads the IdP inactivity timeouts once and short-circuits when no IdP enforces an inactivity timeout (the default configuration), removing the table query and the per-row N+1 lookups from the request path.
- Performance: `expireStaleAcsRequests()` now loads the IdP request timeouts once instead of issuing a query per evaluated row (N+1).

**V1.3.2**
- Fix: SAML request and inactivity timeouts no longer fire on state rows with empty or invalid `loginTime`/`lastClickTime` values. `strtotime('')` returned `false`, which previously made `time() - 0` exceed any configured timeout, instantly expiring states and producing spurious "SAML authentication request timed out" errors on re-authentication.
- Fix: The ACS request timeout now measures the age of the current SAML AuthNRequest instead of the age of the state row. A new `LoginState::setRequestStart()` refreshes `loginTime` every time an AuthNRequest is issued, so re-authenticating after an idle period on a long-lived session no longer fails on the first attempt.
- Fixed issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/145 where custom GLPI_MARKETPLACE_DIR paths caused 404/installation regressions - suggested by @albertogalisteo.
- Fixed issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/141 with JIT rules test route opening missing plugin path - suggested by @KawanCostaNs.

- Fix: Refactored database query and loop assignments inside conditional checks to resolve CodeFactor's "Assignment in condition" warnings.
- Fix: Refactored translation logging messages in User defaults synchronization to use static literal strings and `sprintf` to resolve CodeFactor's "Unnecessary string concatenation" warnings.
- Fix: Replaced raw `TODO` in base64 mock private key template to resolve CodeFactor's "Unresolved TODO comment" warnings.
- Fix: Fixed a loop-overwriting bug in `getTabWarnings` where warning status (⚠️) on configuration tab panels was cleared and overwritten by subsequent clean fields.
- Fix: Resolved a parsing condition in `sp_certificate` and `idp_certificate` where validly parsed certificates skipped passing expiration and default/example certificate warnings to the form fields' errors property.

**V1.3.1**
- Fix: Resolved TypeError: noMethod() expects string, int given on undefined or custom database configuration fields in ConfigItem and LoginFlowItem.
- Fix: Implemented case-insensitive email comparison during JIT user synchronization on login to prevent duplicate `glpi_useremails` insert errors. (Related issues: https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/126, https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/127)
- Feature: Added dynamic FontAwesome CSS parser to populate the LOGIN ICON selector with all available installed icons, sorted alphabetically.

- Fix: Resolved database migration race condition where `loginFlowTrace` column failed to upgrade to `TEXT` if it did not exist prior to update. (Related issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/123)
- Fix: Ensured the `location` column in the login states table does not receive a `null` value when `parse_url()` fails on malformed or empty URIs by defaulting to `'UNKNOWN'`. (Related issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/123)
- Fix: Resolved inactive session timeout bugs by replacing invalid database column queries in cleanSessionSAML CronTask with class constants and protecting the TIMED_OUT phase in evalGlpiAuth.
- Feature: Automatically disable and display warnings on inbound security fields when strict mode is disabled.
- Architecture: Added ADR 0022 documenting the decision to auto-disable inbound security options when strict is off and use prefix-based dynamic stylinrsg for warnings.
- Redesigned the configuration form fields layout to use a modern two-line strategy (Labels and tooltips on line 1, input controls on line 2), preventing squishing and making better use of the available space.
- Implemented soft yellow/warning background styling (via `.form-field-warning-row` class) and borders for rows with active warnings.
- Refactored warnings across all form fields (including those inside General, Transit, and Security tabs) to render elegantly as warning tooltips next to labels, hiding the original text messages.
- Refactored monolithic configForm.html.twig into separate sub-templates for each tab panel inside templates/configForm/.
- Wrapped all remaining hardcoded user-facing fields in Twig templates with i18n translation functions and formatted them for easy localization.
- Fixed translation of Service Provider fields (Entity ID, MetaUrl, AcsUrl, SloUrl) in Twig configuration form templates.
- Architecture: Added ADR 0015 documenting the design, implementation, and environment requirements for the translation automation tool.
- UI: Added a translatable warning tooltip icon next to the "SYNC ON LOGIN" field explaining potential data leak incidents from IDP configuration mistakes. Also formatted the conditional warnings for "ENFORCED" and "STRICT" fields in the same clean hoverable style.
- UI: Restructured the Security tab layout using Bootstrap columns to eliminate empty whitespace and grouped the settings logically into four categories: Enforcement & Sessions, User Provisioning, Inbound Security (IdP), and Outbound Security (SP).
- UI: Restructured the General, Transit, SP, and IdP configuration tabs into consistent card-based logical subject groups with neat right-aligned inputs and responsive layouts.
- Feature: Added inactivity timeout configuration setting allowing administrators to forcefully log out inactive user sessions after a specified duration (default is 0, which disables the inactivity check).
- Feature: Implemented passive ACS request evaluation during user logins to automatically clean up and forcefully expire stale pending authentication states.



**V1.3.0**
- Fix: Removed 'after' statements from database field migrations to prevent update/installation errors due to non-existent columns. (Related issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/119)
- Feature: Added proactive GLPI cache reset during plugin installation/upgrade using CacheManager::resetAllCaches(). (Related issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/119)
- Architecture: Added ADR 0014 documenting the design decision to clear GLPI cache during installation/upgrade. (Related issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/119)
- Fix: Resolved a critical nested form structure conflict in the Twig template (`configForm.html.twig`) that incorrectly triggered `forcelogoff` actions when saving configuration updates.
- Fix: Prevented SSO login/redirection flow interception on active administrator sessions by skipping `doAuth()` and local login blocks if `Session::getLoginUserID()` is active.
- Fix: Ensured the multiple active IDPs warning message is always displayed on the Enforce SSO field in the configuration UI when more than one IDP is active.
- Fix: Reset database session phase to `PHASE_INITIAL` when GLPI session is expired, ensuring SSO enforcement redirects work correctly for returning users with lingering cookies. (Related issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/25)
- Feature: Added configurable SAML request timeout fallback to automatically expire stale authentication states after a set duration (default 15 minutes) - by @eduardomozart
- Security Fix: Addressed local login SSO enforcement bypass securely using server-side session variable checks instead of a spoofable Referer check - by @eduardomozart
- Merged PR 114: Added country code 'ZZ' fallback tooltip and image display - by @eduardomozart
- Merged PR 115: Replaced custom copy buttons with native is_copyable attribute - by @eduardomozart
- Merged PR 116: Enforced access control checks with Session::checkRight and added user avatars - by @eduardomozart
- Merged PR 117: Separated translation links and added PO/POT generator - by @eduardomozart
- Merged PR 118: Added user fields matching support in rule criteria - by @eduardomozart
- Implemented configurable SAML claim mapping for GLPI user fields with predefined presets (Entra ID, Okta, Keycloak) and observed claims tracking.
- Refactored installation/uninstallation routines using a central class registry and single migration instance.
- Hardened logout and Single Logout (SLO) confirmation rendering, local logout redirection paths, and auto-login loop prevention.
- Added automated test validation pre-checks to the release packaging script.
- Fixed static analysis warnings, type declarations, compliance checks, and translation domain issues across source files.
- Fixed issue https://github.com/DonutsNL/samlsso/issues/51 where user JIT creation bypassed the Identity Provider configuration.
- UI: Refactored the Backup & Restore section on the IDP list page into a collapsible panel triggered by a subtle outline toggle button, reducing visual weight while keeping the feature accessible.
- UI: Wrapped the "Template & View XML" tools on the Claim Mapping tab into a collapsible "Tools" panel, consistent with the Backup & Restore treatment.
- UI: Claim mappings are now ordered deterministically — enforced (system) mappings are always shown first, followed by manually added mappings in insertion order.
- Reliability: Replaced `::class` constants in the `PLUGIN_SAMLSSO_CLASSES` array in `setup.php` with fully-qualified string literals so the constant can be safely defined before the Composer autoloader is registered (i.e. when the plugin is disabled).
- Reliability: Added `include_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'` to `hook.php` so plugin classes are always resolvable during install/uninstall, even when `plugin_init_samlsso()` (which normally loads the autoloader) has not run.
- Reliability: Replaced `ClassName::getTable()` / `self::getTable()` calls inside `install()` and `uninstall()` lifecycle methods with `getTableForItemType(static::class)` across `Config`, `ClaimMap`, `ObservedClaim`, `Exclude`, and `LoginState`, using the GLPI-recommended function that performs pure string manipulation with no dependency on plugin state.
- Testing: Updated `LifecycleIntegrityTest.php` class parser to support both the legacy `::class` constant format and the new quoted string literal format in `PLUGIN_SAMLSSO_CLASSES`.
- Fix: Corrected signed `INT` foreign key columns (`configs_id` in `ObservedClaim` and `ClaimMap`; `idpId` in `LoginState`) to `INT UNSIGNED` to silence GLPI 11 deprecation warnings; added upgrade migrations to fix existing installations.
- Feature: Added `sync_on_login` configuration option to automatically update user claim mappings and rerun the rules engine on every successful user login.
- Refactored Claim Mappings to use class constants instead of raw strings for target fields and target types, improving consistency and maintainability.
- Refactored SAML claim resolution, defaults, and requirements validation logic out of `User.php` and into `ClaimMapEntity.php` helper methods.
- Decomposed large methods in `User.php`, `Acs.php`, and `LoginFlow.php` into descriptive private helper methods to improve readability.
- Standardized project-wide class layout and structure rules (constants at the top, chronological method ordering, and database schema hooks at the bottom) documented in ADR 0010.
- Cleaned up unused imports and normalized FQCN references across source files.
- Removed unused `SCHEMA_*` and `USERDATA` constants from `User.php` that are no longer referenced after the mapping refactor.
- Cleaned up unused and deprecated methods (`trackObservedClaim` in `ClaimMapEntity.php`; `setSamlResponseParams`, `setRequestParams`, and `isLoadedFromDb` in `LoginState.php`) detected by dead-code analysis.
- Feature: Added offline GeoIP originating country flag resolution. Client IPs are stored and matched using a high-performance binary search resolver (`GeoIPResolver`) on a compact local database (`ip_to_country.bin`). Flags are rendered as native browser emojis with full country hover tooltips in the session log UI.
- CLI Tool: Added `tools/update_geoip.php` to fetch DB-IP Lite country CSV databases and compile them into the optimized binary database format.
- Testing: Integrated `GeoIPTest.php` to verify offline database country matching and emoji flag conversions.
- Fix: Prevented SAML SSO auto-redirect logic from running on AJAX/sub-requests (e.g., translation fetch) to avoid session state phase corruption and ensure top-level pages correctly redirect to the IdP when SSO is enforced.
- Architecture: Added ADR 0011 documenting the decision to skip SAML SSO redirection on AJAX requests.
- Fix: Updated session log UI to render country flags using FlagCDN PNG images rather than native OS-dependent emoji characters, ensuring correct rendering on platforms like Windows.
- Fix: Automatically disable the SSO Enforce option (`enforce_sso`) via `ConfigEntity::validateAdvancedConfig()` when multiple active IDPs exist, and display a warning inline in the configuration form rather than as a redirect message.
- Architecture: Added ADR 0012 explaining the multi-IDP Enforce conflict resolution mechanism and the explicit design decision not to follow the GLPI standard redirect-based messages.
- Feature: Added administrative action to forcefully log off and disable users directly from the active sessions log table.
- Architecture: Added ADR 0013 documenting the design and security of the force logoff and disable user action.

- Security Fix: Implemented strict "Open Redirect" protection. The `redirect` parameter is now validated to allow only relative paths, preventing attackers from using GLPI as an open relay.
- Security Fix: Hardened error logs by implementing conditional redaction. Sensitive SAML data is now redacted by default unless "Debug" is explicitly enabled in the IDP configuration.
- Fix: Replaced non-existent `DBConnection::getDefaultDatabase()` with `$DB->dbdefault` for compatibility with GLPI 10.0+.
- Architecture: Added ADR 0002 documenting the rationale for LoginState hardening and DB compatibility fixes.

  to evaluate if the button for the entity needs to be shown.
- Extended `doAuth` in `src/LoginFlow.php` to also evaluate username field in login screen and match it
  with idp configured userdomain. This allows a user to simply 'provide' its username and press login triggering
  a saml request if the domain in the username matches a given idp's userdomain configuration.
- Updated the loginbutton logic to not show on the login page if there are no buttons to show.
- Added a test `popover` in the config screen with the `copy meta url button` to see if that cleans
